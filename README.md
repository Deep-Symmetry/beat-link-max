## Funding

Beat Link is, and will remain, completely free and open-source. If it
has helped you, taught you something, or inspired you, please let us
know and share some of your discoveries and how you are using it! If
you'd like to financially support its ongoing development, you are
welcome (but by no means obligated) to donate to offset the hundreds
of hours of research, development, and writing that have already been
invested. Or perhaps to facilitate future efforts, tools, toys, and
time to explore.
